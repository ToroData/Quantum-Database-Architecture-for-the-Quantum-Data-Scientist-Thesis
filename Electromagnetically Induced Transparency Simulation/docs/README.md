# Electromagnetically Induced Transparency (EIT): Simulation and Visualization

This project hosts a simulation of Electromagnetically Induced Transparency (EIT) as well as the final visualization of the real and imaginary part of the first-order electrical susceptibility. This repository belongs to the BSc thesis. The scheme proposed in the EIT is a three-level quantum optics system in Lambda configuration.

## Features

- Numerical simulation of EIT based on the Lindblad equation.
- Visualization of real and imaginary part of the first-order susceptibility.
- Conda environment to provide a replicable framework.

## Project Structure

- `src/`: Contains the simulation code and calculations.
  - `calculations.py`: Defines the EIT calculations.
- `plots/`: Contains plotting and visualization tools.
  - `plot_config.py`: Configures the plot styles.
  - `plot_generator.py`: Generates the plots.
- `doc/`: Documentation for the project.
- `environment.yml`: Conda environment file.
- `main.py`: Entry point for running the project.

## Installation

Run:

```bash
conda env create -f environment.yml
conda activate eit_env
```

## Usage

Run:

```python
python main.py
```

## Configuration

The user can experimentally adjust the simulation parameters in `src/config.py` file. The user can provide different values for the decay rates, Rabi frequencies, or detuning values.
